# Emotion-AI-Facial-Key-Points-Detection
In this lesson, I implemented deep learning models, specifically focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend, to build and train a facial key-points detection model.
#The project includes:
-**Theory and Intuition:** In-depth explanations of the theoretical foundations and practical insights behind CNNs and Residual Networks, illustrating how these architectures contribute to advancements in deep learning.
-**Model Implementation:** Building and training of a deep learning model leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks and Residual blocks using Keras with TensorFlow 2.0 as the backend. The implementation includes code for constructing, training, and fine-tuning these models.
-**Performance Assessment:** Evaluation of model performance through various key performance indicators (KPIs), ensuring effective generalization and robustness of the trained CNN models.
